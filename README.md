## Getting complete information on a Cohort, Module and Lesson
- Open file 'GetGroupModuleLessonData.csv', enter the cohort, module and lesson for which you want 
  to get information about the presence/absence of tabs (Plan, Theory, Homework, Code, Video) and 
  information about the presence/absence of data in each of these tabs.
- Open the 'GroupModuleLessonInfoTests' class in UI-tests.
  The report folder gives the following information options:
1) if the entered cohort, module and lesson exist, it gives information about the presence of tabs 
  in the lesson 
  (if there is no tab, then "0"; 
  if there is a tab and it contains information, then "+";
  if there is a tab and it doesn't contain information, then "-";
  if there is a video tab and it contains video, then the number of attached videos is written,
  if there is a video tab and it doesn't contain video, then "-");
2) if the entered cohort or module or lesson does not exist, it gives information about absence

- The result look in folder 'result'.

## Getting complete information on a Cohort and Module

  information about the presence/absence of data in each of these tabs.
- Open the 'GroupAndModuleInfoTests' class in UI-tests.
  The report folder gives the following information options:
1) if the entered cohort and module exist, it gives information about all lessons and the presence 
  of tabs in the lesson
  (if there is no tab, then "0";
  if there is a tab and it contains information, then "+";
  if there is a tab and it doesn't contain information, then "-";
  if there is a video tab and it contains video, then the number of attached videos is written,
